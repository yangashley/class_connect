  <p>Teachers can use this behavior management app to track student behavior. Teachers can encourage students to choose positive choices by giving points. If necessary, points can also be deducted. The app also enables students to track their performance during the school day. The teacher, who can give and deduct points, is the primary user of the app. The classroom page and student page can be displayed to provide students with feedback about their performance.</p>
